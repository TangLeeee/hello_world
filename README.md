A new start

I'm xcy, and life is goning on, something different would like to happen.

Now i'm majoring in blockchain and SDN and some data pricing work in Tsing university, People here are smart and hard working, and living a busy life. Whatever it's a honor to be here for one year learning. Beijing is a good place. 

Hope back to school with satisfaction.
