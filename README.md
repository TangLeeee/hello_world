# Hello_world
A new start

I'm xcy, life is goning on, and something different would like to happen.

Now I'm majoring in blockchain and SDN and some data pricing work in Tsing university. People here are smart and hard working, living a busy life. So we don't have much chance to communicate with them. The most important thing is that you need to learn by yourself. 
Whatever it's a honor to be here for one year learning. Beijing is a good place. 

Hope back to school with satisfaction.
