# Hello_world

    A new start

    I'm xcy, life is goning on, and something different would like to happen.

    Now I'm majoring in blockchain and SDN and some data pricing work in Tsing Hua university academically.
    People here are smart and hard working, living a busy life. So we don't have much chance to communicate with them.
    And I've found that it's their attitude they toward their life, study and work that makes them diffent from others.
    Keep doing something every single day. Strive for excellence and Only time will tell your efforts.
    Whatever it's a honor to be here for one year learning. Beijing is a good place. 

    Hope back to school with satisfaction.
